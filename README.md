# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Created a Weather Dashboard application that uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities that are searched for by user. Uses localStorage to store any cities that have been searched for prior and allows user to call them up quickly. This application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
